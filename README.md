- 3) Total Pizzas Sold – 50,000
- 4) Total Orders – 21,000
- 5) Average Pizzas per Order – 2

### QUESTIONS
- 1) The busiest days are Thursday (3239 orders), Friday (3538 orders) and Saturday (3158 orders). Most sales are recorded on Friday
- 2) Most orders are placed between 12pm to 1pm, and 5pm to 7pm
- 3) Classic pizza has the highest percentage sales (26.91%), followed by Supreme (25.46%), Chicken (23.96%) and Veggie (23.68%) pizzas 
- 4) Large size pizzas record the highest sales (45.89%) followed by medium (30.49%), then small (21.77%). XL and XXL only account for 1.72% and 0.12% respectively 
- 5) Classic Pizza accounts for the highest sales (14,888 pizzas) followed by Supreme (11,987 pizzas), Veggie (11,649 pizzas) and Chicken (11,050 pizzas)
- 6) Top 5 Best Sellers are the Classic Deluxe (2453 pizzas), Barbecue Chicken (2432 pizzas), Hawaiian (2422), Peperoni (2418 pizzas) and Thai Chicken (2371 pizzas)
- 7) Bottom 5 Worst Sellers are Brie Carre (490 pizzas), Mediterranean (934 pizzas), Calabrese (937 pizzas), Spinach Supreme (950 pizzas) and Soppressata (961).


## CONCLUSION:
The outlet should capitalize on Large size Classic, Supreme, Veggie and Chicken pizzas.

Since XL and XXL pizzas account for such a small percentage of their sales (just 1.94%), they can safely get rid of these pizza sizes.

Even though the Brie Carre pizza is the worst seller, it recorded 490 pizzas sold. It would still be a good idea to keep it in the menu.
